### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, originally from Athens and currently living in Berlin. Although I have an engineering background and hold a Diploma in Civil Engineering, I have shifted my focus towards software development. Inspired by the vibrant tech scene in Berlin, I've delved into programming, totally loving the problem-solving and creativity it brings to the table.
